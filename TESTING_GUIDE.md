## Testing with Video Clips

### Method 1: Upload Video Files

#### Step 1: Add Video Clip

1. Click the **"+" button** in the prompt input area
2. Select **"Upload file"**
3. Choose a clip from your training data:
   - Location: `gs://uball-training-data/games/{game_id}/clips/`
   - Example: `{play_id}_broadcast.mp4` or `{play_id}_tactical.mp4`
4. Wait for upload to complete

#### Step 2: Add Text Prompt

After uploading the video, add your prompt:

```
Analyze this basketball play in detail. Describe:
1. The offensive strategy being executed
2. Key player movements and positioning
3. Defensive response and coverage
4. The outcome and effectiveness of the play
5. Any tactical insights or notable moments
```

#### Step 3: Run the Test

1. Click **"Submit"** or press `Enter`
2. Wait for the model to process (10-30 seconds for video)
3. Review the generated analysis

### Method 2: Reference GCS Videos

Instead of uploading, you can reference videos directly from GCS:

```
Analyze the basketball play in this video:
gs://uball-training-data/games/23135de8-36ca-4882-bdf1-8796cd8caa8a/clips/abc123_broadcast.mp4

Provide a detailed tactical breakdown.
```

### Method 3: Use Multiple Angles

Test with both broadcast and tactical angles:

```
Compare these two views of the same play:

Broadcast view: [upload broadcast clip]
Tactical view: [upload tactical clip]

Analyze what additional insights the tactical view provides 
compared to the broadcast view.
```

## Interpreting Results

### What to Look For

**1. Accuracy**
- Does the model correctly identify the play type?
- Are player movements accurately described?
- Is the tactical analysis sound?

**2. Detail Level**
- Is the analysis sufficiently detailed?
- Does it cover all requested aspects?
- Are technical terms used correctly?

**3. Consistency**
- Test the same clip multiple times
- Results should be consistent (with some variation)
- Core analysis should remain stable

**4. Comparison to Ground Truth**
- Compare to your training data descriptions
- Check if the model's style matches training examples
- Verify tactical accuracy

### Evaluating Model Performance

## Best Practices

### 1. Systematic Testing

Test across different categories:

- **Play Types**: 
  - Pick and roll
  - Isolation
  - Fast break
  - Half-court sets
  - Out-of-bounds plays

- **Angles**:
  - Broadcast view
  - Tactical view
  - Both angles together

- **Game Situations**:
  - Early game
  - Close game
  - Blowout
  - End-of-quarter

### 2. Prompt Engineering

**Be Specific**:
```
‚ùå "Analyze this play."

‚úÖ "Analyze this pick and roll play. Focus on the screen setter's 
positioning, the ball handler's decision-making, and how the 
defense responds to the action."
```

**Provide Context**:
```
This is a late-game situation with 30 seconds left and the team 
down by 2 points. Analyze the play execution and decision-making.

[attach video]
```

**Ask for Structure**:
```
Analyze this play using the following structure:
1. Initial setup and positioning
2. Primary action
3. Defensive response
4. Secondary action or adjustment
5. Outcome and evaluation

[attach video]
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic analysis prompts
2. **Add Detail**: Gradually increase complexity
3. **Test Variations**: Try different phrasings
4. **Track Results**: Keep notes on what works best

### 4. Batch Testing

Test multiple clips in sequence:

```
I will show you 3 plays. Analyze each one separately:

Play 1: [upload clip 1]
Play 2: [upload clip 2]
Play 3: [upload clip 3]

For each, describe the offensive strategy and defensive response.
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. System Instructions

Use system instructions to set consistent behavior:

```
You are a professional basketball analyst. Always structure your 
analysis in the following format:

**Play Overview**: Brief summary
**Offensive Strategy**: Detailed breakdown
**Defensive Response**: Coverage and adjustments
**Key Moments**: Critical decisions or plays
**Evaluation**: Effectiveness rating (1-10) with justification

Use technical basketball terminology and reference specific 
positions by number when possible.
```

### 2. Few-Shot Examples

Include example analyses in your prompt:

```
Example analysis format:

[Example play description from your training data]

Now analyze this new play:
[attach video]
```

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversations

Build on previous responses:

```
Turn 1: "Analyze this play."
[Model responds]

Turn 2: "Now focus specifically on the help defense rotation."
[Model provides detailed focus]

Turn 3: "What could the offense have done differently?"
[Model suggests alternatives]
```
