**Your Model's Training Format** (Use this!):
```
You are a basketball play analyzer. Your job is to analyze video clips 
and return structured JSON data about basketball plays.

For each play, identify:
1. timestamp_seconds: When the play occurs
2. classification: Event type (FG_MAKE, FG_MISS, 3PT_MAKE, 3PT_MISS, 
   FREE_THROW_MAKE, FREE_THROW_MISS, REBOUND, ASSIST, STEAL, BLOCK, 
   TURNOVER, FOUL, TIMEOUT, SUB)
3. note: Detailed description of what happened
4. player_a: Primary player (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
5. player_b: Secondary player if applicable
6. events: Array of all events in the play

Return response as a JSON array.
```

**Alternative (For Natural Language Responses)**:
```
You are an expert basketball analyst. Analyze plays and provide 
detailed, natural language descriptions of:
- Player movements and positioning
- Offensive and defensive strategies
- Key moments and tactical decisions

Note: This may produce less consistent results than the JSON format 
your model was trained on.
```

### 4. Prompt Input Area
- Main area where you compose your prompts
- Supports:
  - Text input
  - File uploads (videos, images)
  - Multiple media items
  - Formatted text

### 5. Tools Panel (Bottom Left)

---

## Testing with Video Clips

### Method 1: Upload Video Files

#### Step 1: Add Video Clip

1. Click the **"+" button** in the prompt input area
2. Select **"Upload file"**
3. Choose a clip from your training data:
   - Location: `gs://uball-training-data/games/{game_id}/clips/`
   - Example: `{play_id}_broadcast.mp4` or `{play_id}_tactical.mp4`
4. Wait for upload to complete

#### Step 2: Add Text Prompt

After uploading the video, add your prompt:

```
Analyze this basketball play in detail. Describe:
1. The offensive strategy being executed
2. Key player movements and positioning
3. Defensive response and coverage
4. The outcome and effectiveness of the play
5. Any tactical insights or notable moments
```

#### Step 3: Run the Test

1. Click **"Submit"** or press `Enter`
2. Wait for the model to process (10-30 seconds for video)
3. Review the generated analysis

### Method 2: Reference GCS Videos

Instead of uploading, you can reference videos directly from GCS:

```
Analyze the basketball play in this video:
gs://uball-training-data/games/23135de8-36ca-4882-bdf1-8796cd8caa8a/clips/abc123_broadcast.mp4

Provide a detailed tactical breakdown.
```

### Method 3: Use Multiple Angles

Test with both broadcast and tactical angles:

```
Compare these two views of the same play:

Broadcast view: [upload broadcast clip]
Tactical view: [upload tactical clip]

Analyze what additional insights the tactical view provides 
compared to the broadcast view.
```

---

## Prompt Templates for Testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Your model was trained to expect a **specific prompt format**. Use these exact templates for best results!

### 1. Exact Training Format (Recommended) ‚úÖ

**For Broadcast/Wide Angle Clips:**
```
Analyze this basketball game video from FAR_RIGHT camera angle and identify the play with its events.

This is a FAR_RIGHT camera view that provides wide court view and team formation context.

For the play, provide:
1. timestamp_seconds: The time in the video when the play occurs (number)
2. classification: The primary event type (FG_MAKE, FG_MISS, 3PT_MAKE, 3PT_MISS, FREE_THROW_MAKE, FREE_THROW_MISS, REBOUND, ASSIST, STEAL, BLOCK, TURNOVER, FOUL, TIMEOUT, SUB)
3. note: A detailed description of what happened (string)
4. player_a: The primary player involved (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
5. player_b: Secondary player if applicable (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
6. events: Array of all events in the play, each with:
   - label: Event type (same options as classification)
   - playerA: Player identifier (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
   - playerB: Secondary player if applicable

Return a JSON array with the single play. Be precise with timestamps and identify all basketball events.

[attach video clip]
```

**For Tactical/Close-up Angle Clips:**
```
Analyze this basketball game video from NEAR_LEFT camera angle and identify the play with its events.

This is a NEAR_LEFT camera view that provides close-up details of player numbers and jerseys.

For the play, provide:
1. timestamp_seconds: The time in the video when the play occurs (number)
2. classification: The primary event type (FG_MAKE, FG_MISS, 3PT_MAKE, 3PT_MISS, FREE_THROW_MAKE, FREE_THROW_MISS, REBOUND, ASSIST, STEAL, BLOCK, TURNOVER, FOUL, TIMEOUT, SUB)
3. note: A detailed description of what happened (string)
4. player_a: The primary player involved (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
5. player_b: Secondary player if applicable (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
6. events: Array of all events in the play, each with:
   - label: Event type (same options as classification)
   - playerA: Player identifier (format: "Player #X (Color Team)")
   - playerB: Secondary player if applicable

Return a JSON array with the single play. Be precise with timestamps and identify all basketball events.

[attach video clip]
```

### 2. Simplified Format (If You Want Natural Language)

**Basic Play Analysis:**
```
Analyze this basketball play. Describe:
- What type of play it is (shot, turnover, etc.)
- Which players are involved
- What happened step by step

[attach video clip]
```

**Note**: The simplified format may produce less accurate results since the model was trained on structured JSON output.

---

## Interpreting Results

### Expected Output Format

Your model was trained to return **structured JSON**. Here's what to expect:

**Example Output:**
```json
[{
  "timestamp_seconds": 2848.5,
  "classification": "FG_MAKE",
  "note": "Gray #7 made a layup.",
  "player_a": "Player #7 (Gray)",
  "player_b": null,
  "events": [{
    "label": "FG_MAKE",
    "playerA": "Player #7 (Gray)",
    "playerB": null,
    "playerAId": "0210b121-a6d9-4261-b184-abb11f84301c",
    "playerBId": null
  }]
}]
```

**For Complex Plays:**
```json
[{
  "timestamp_seconds": 668.8,
  "classification": "3PT_MISS",
  "note": "Player #1 (Black) missed a 3-pointer, and G5 rebounded.",
  "player_a": "Player #1 (Black)",
  "player_b": null,
  "events": [
    {
      "label": "3PT_MISS",
      "playerA": "Player #1 (Black)",
      "playerB": null,
      "playerAId": "989ec7b2-9452-4d3a-9dcf-b62ea45d165e",
      "playerBId": null
    },
    {
      "label": "REBOUND",
      "playerA": null,
      "playerB": null,
      "playerAId": null,
      "playerBId": null
    }
  ]
}]
```

### What to Look For

**1. Accuracy**
- Does the model correctly identify the play type?
- Are player numbers and team colors correct?
- Is the event classification accurate (FG_MAKE vs 3PT_MAKE)?
- Are timestamps reasonable?

**2. JSON Structure**
- Is the output valid JSON?
- Are all required fields present?
- Is the format consistent with training data?

**3. Event Completeness**
- Are all events in the play captured?

- Are secondary events (rebounds, assists) included?

**4. Consistency**
- Test the same clip multiple times
- JSON structure should be identical
- Classifications should not change
- Note descriptions may vary slightly

**5. Comparison to Ground Truth**
- Compare to your training data descriptions
- Check if player identification matches
- Verify event classifications

- **Play Types**: 
  - Pick and roll
  - Isolation
  - Fast break
  - Half-court sets
  - Out-of-bounds plays

- **Angles**:
  - Broadcast view
  - Tactical view
  - Both angles together

- **Game Situations**:
  - Early game
  - Close game
  - Blowout
  - End-of-quarter

### 2. Prompt Engineering

**Be Specific**:
```
‚ùå "Analyze this play."

‚úÖ "Analyze this pick and roll play. Focus on the screen setter's 
positioning, the ball handler's decision-making, and how the 
defense responds to the action."
```

**Provide Context**:
```
This is a late-game situation with 30 seconds left and the team 
down by 2 points. Analyze the play execution and decision-making.

[attach video]
```

**Ask for Structure**:
```
Analyze this play using the following structure:
1. Initial setup and positioning
2. Primary action
3. Defensive response
4. Secondary action or adjustment
5. Outcome and evaluation

[attach video]
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic analysis prompts
2. **Add Detail**: Gradually increase complexity
3. **Test Variations**: Try different phrasings
4. **Track Results**: Keep notes on what works best

### 4. Batch Testing

Test multiple clips in sequence:

```
I will show you 3 plays. Analyze each one separately:

Play 1: [upload clip 1]
Play 2: [upload clip 2]
Play 3: [upload clip 3]

For each, describe the offensive strategy and defensive response.
```
