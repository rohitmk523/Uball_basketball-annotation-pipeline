# 🏀 Basketball AI Training & Annotation System
## Technical Approach & Implementation Strategy

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

We've built an **AI-powered basketball video annotation system** that automatically analyzes game footage and generates detailed play-by-play annotations. The system uses **Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro AI model**, fine-tuned specifically for basketball analysis.

### **What This System Does:**
- 📹 **Input**: Raw basketball game videos 
- 🤖 **Process**: AI analyzes the footage using computer vision
- 📊 **Output**: Structured data with timestamps, player actions, and game events

---

## 🧠 **How AI Training Works**

### **Phase 1: Initial Model Training**

```
Manual Annotations (Human Experts) → AI Model Training → Smart Basketball AI
```

**Step 1: Human Expert Annotations**
- Basketball analysts manually annotate 1,500+ plays
- Each play includes: timestamps, player positions, actions, outcomes
- Data stored in structured format (Supabase database)

**Step 2: AI Model Fine-Tuning**
- Take Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro (general AI model)
- Train it specifically on basketball footage and annotations
- Model learns basketball-specific patterns and terminology

**Step 3: Model Deployment**
- Deploy trained model to Google Cloud
- Create API endpoint for real-time video analysis

### **Phase 2: Continuous Learning (Incremental Training)**

```
New Game Videos → Human Review → AI Gets Smarter → Better Annotations
```

**The Smart Part:** Each new game makes the AI better!

1. **New Game Analysis**: AI analyzes new game footage
2. **Human Review**: Experts review and correct AI annotations  
3. **Model Update**: AI learns from corrections
4. **Improved Performance**: Next game analysis is more accurate

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Multi-Angle Training Strategy**

**Problem**: Basketball games have multiple camera angles, but we want the AI to understand the full court.

**Solution**: Smart angle pairing for training

```
LEFT Side Plays → Train with:  FAR_LEFT + NEAR_RIGHT cameras
RIGHT Side Plays → Train with: FAR_RIGHT + NEAR_LEFT cameras
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Full court coverage**: AI sees both ends of the court
- ✅ **Multiple perspectives**: Different angles reduce blind spots  
- ✅ **Better accuracy**: AI learns spatial relationships
- ✅ **Reduced noise**: Opposite angles filter out irrelevant action

### **Video Processing Pipeline**

```
📹 Raw Game Video (2+ hours)
    ↓
🎬 Smart Clip Extraction (10-30 second segments)
    ↓ 
🤖 AI Analysis (Computer Vision + NLP)
    ↓
📊 Structured Data Output (JSON format)
    ↓
💾 Database Storage (Searchable & Queryable)
```

### **Performance Optimizations (Phase 1)**

**Challenge**: Processing 2-hour game videos was taking 2+ hours

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple video segments simultaneously (5x faster)
2. **Smart Caching**: Store frequently accessed videos locally (80% fewer downloads)
3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from network failures (90% fewer errors)

**Result**: Processing time reduced from **2 hours → 20 minutes**

## 🔄 **Training Process Workflow**

### **Option A: Local Development (POC)**

```bash
1. Export Training Data
   python scripts/training/export_plays.py
   
2. Extract Video Clips (Parallel Processing)
   python scripts/training/extract_clips.py --workers 4 --cache-size 20GB
   
3. Train AI Model
   python scripts/training/train_vertex_ai.py
   
4. Deploy Model
   python scripts/training/deploy_model.py
```

### **Option B: Production (Google Cloud Workflows)**

```bash
# Single command triggers entire pipeline
gcloud workflows run basketball-training-pipeline \
  --data='{"game_id": "new-game-uuid"}'

# Workflow automatically:
# 1. Exports plays from database
# 2. Extracts training clips  
# 3. Formats data for AI training
# 4. Trains model on Vertex AI
# 5. Deploys updated model
# 6. Sends completion notification
```

## 🎮 **How Game Analysis Works**

### **Real-Time Video Annotation**

**API Call Example:**
```json
POST /api/annotate
{
  "game_id": "abc-123-def",
  "angle": "LEFT",
  "force_reprocess": false
}
```

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

1. **Video Retrieval**: System downloads game video from cloud storage
2. **Preprocessing**: Video is split into analyzable segments
3. **AI Analysis**: Each segment is sent to the trained model
4. **Result Processing**: AI output is structured and validated
5. **Database Storage**: Annotations are saved with timestamps
6. **API Response**: Structured results returned to client

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "job-xyz789",
  "status": "completed", 
  "plays_created": 47,
  "processing_time": "18 minutes",
  "accuracy_confidence": "94%"
}
```
